                    <h3>At the intersection of Science, Art, and Business</h3>
                    <p>
                        Software Development is much more than just uploading a website or following a tutorial on Youtube.
                        It's about stakeholder management, needs of the clients, needs of the customers, needs of the business, keeping up with trends in Search Engine Optimization ("SEO"),
                        trends in technology, and anything that interfaces with the website (ordering, stock keeping, production systems),
                        outlines, sketches, user stories, graphics, photography, various marketing tactics, understanding the marketing mix, data, analytics, other business components,
                        and then finally code it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started coding during my childhood, made websites while I pursued other interests, then finally decided to go to college for it. After this I worked
                        in a Small/Medium Enterprise (SME) which had a diverse range of clients with widely different requirements, such as PIPEDA and various regulatory
                        requirements related to their respective industries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However in this industry, Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and discretion in general prohibit my usual style of loading up my website with images.
                        So in the spirit of disclosure in "general and broad terms" here are some of the technologies I have used.

                        <h3>WordPress</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is great for getting a website off the ground faster than a hand-coded website, much faster.
                            Less customization as far as what can be done with it, but when combined with <a target="_blank" href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> for an e-commerce store,
                            and a well-developed theme such as Elegant Theme's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/">Divi</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/extra/">Extra</a>,
                            and E-mail leads managed through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/plugins/bloom/">Bloom</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a>,
                            or <a target="_blank" href="https://mailchimp.com/en-ca/">MailChimp</a>, you can have a great e-commerce site. However, WordPress is built with SEO in mind, so your site can
                            help to rank-up more on Google searches by using the <a target="_blank" href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast plugin</a>.

                        <h3>Rolled-by-hand website</h3>
                        <p>
                            Rolling a website by hand is the most time-consuming to build, launch, and update like this website. While it is much more expensive and time consuming to use less automation,
                            it gives the developer complete control over how the website looks and operates, without much vendor lock-in. Good for websites which do not change often. However, if the requirements
                            call for a large website, with very specific requirements, and a budget to match, then a custom, hand-made website may be the only way to accomplish the task. I have built business
                            portals which change their view and how they look dependent upon the user's role, such as if they are an employee, manager, system administrator, or customer. In the past I have used
                            a programming language called PHP, a very popular and widespread programming language for functional websites. I have also had to program for restrictive requirements, such as
                            PIPEDA, Canadian data retention and warehousing requirements, auditable processes, additional security and best practices, no outside code packages, and more.

                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify, Inc</a> provides an interesting offering which allows for more rapid prototyping, always up-to-date and secure underneath, and runs on Google Cloud infrastructure. In some respects it takes slightly
                            longer but allows for easy use, and Google Cloud is hard to beat for uptime, and has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shopify.com/climate">sustainability at it's core purpose</a>. As a Shopify Partner I can manage e-commerce websites more effectively.

                            While many things have been relegated to the web browser to task with, and with good reason for security purposes and rapid development, there is still plenty
                            of space for application development running on Windows and Linux operating systems. I use C#, Python, and in the past also C, and C++. I have also tried other
                            programming languages such as Java SE (Standard) and Java EE (Enterprise), but I prefer a less buggy development environment and stack.

                        <h3>Databases</h3>
                        <p>
                            I love databases, they are often very reliable, have many options, and for the most part use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27axs9dO7AE">Structured Query Language (SQL)</a>. SQL is great because it allows a database
                            user to understand one system or another without too much vendor lock-in. Learn SQL, you have a great basis for MySQL, MariaDB, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/">PostgreSQL</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF8n-8DPvjc">Microsoft SQL Server</a>.
                            Many other database systems exist, many small boutique database systems which are designed for specific use cases. The latest <a target="_blank" href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> boasts that it "scales from bigdata to mobile"
                            which is impressive and is used by some Fortune 500 companies. This uses an extended/updated language called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhxvXb5zUy8">NoSQL</a> which means "Not only Structured Query Language" which
                            is a modern and useful extension and expansion of the existing SQL language. Lastly, SQL, NoSQL, and databases are extremely essential in modern computing, and exist
                            almost everywhere in computing systems.

                            Ultimately the world wide web is a visual medium which ideally presents a beautiful and intuitive interface which creates an artistic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tismotech.com/project/web-hmi-a-low-cost-modern-and-remotely-accessible-user-interface-for-instruments/">Human-Machine Interface</a>.
                            Often, a client may need a new logo, new marketing materials, or at least a refresh. I use industry leading Adobe Creative Cloud, as well as free tools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://inkscape.org/">InkScape</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://inkscape.org/">GIMP</a>
                            for artwork. Other times, a client may request to hire a 3rd party designer or to start a contest competition to see what the wider artistic community can create, which is best offered by <a target="_blank" href="https://99designs.ca/">99designs</a>.
                            Another interesting development in the art world is the use of automation and software libraries to perform image editing on a website, in real-time, my favourite being the famous
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva.</a> More specialised software brings colour grading to photos and video media. Another development is the use of artificial intelligence which
                            can determine with fine accuracy what colour specifications and look up table algorithms to use to enhance the final product. Two of the leading products are <a target="_blank" href="https://skylum.com/luminar">LuminarAI</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://skylum.com/luminar">Luminar Neo</a>.

                        <p>
                            Audio Editing is often a technical and knowledge-based solution to modifing sound. At its base level, <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-hippies-were-right-its-all-about-vibrations-man/">"all things in our universe are constantly in motion, vibrating.
                            Even objects that appear to be stationary are in fact vibrating, oscillating, resonating, at various frequencies. Resonance is a type of motion, characterized by oscillation between two states. And ultimately all matter is just vibrations of various underlying fields." - Tam Hunt</a>.
                            This means that physics and mathematics play an integral part of sound, and is why audio editing and audio engineering are fascinating fields of study. I began my audio editing experience as a student of physics, and later on out of necessity.
                            I principally use Audacity, a free audio editing package, which has received much critism lately as spyware/logware.

                        <p>
                            Microsoft Office, including Microsoft Visio (for diagramming), Microsoft Project (Project Management), are often used for analysis due to its easy of use, and quick prototyping. Microsoft Access is the commonly used
                            database system which integrates with Microsoft Office, however over time Microsoft Office has evolved to use other data sources as well. Not only is Microsoft Office important
                            in software development, but in almost every profession. While I know how to use KingSoft Office and LibreOffice, they are inferior in quality to Microsoft Office. I have also used
                            a variety of random software to accomplish tasks such as renaming batches of files, ingesting video and audio, working with compressed and encrypted files, and so forth.

                            With studying several different fields, knowledge and experience can be combined to create technological solutions which meet even the most demanding business requirements.

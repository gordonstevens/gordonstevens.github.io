## Introduction

> This is a great story of how I have evolved and continue to evolve as a web developer

Being a web developer means knowing a lot of small details and bundling them together together to make a great website. I started building websites for my very first job in 1999, and I still enjoy it to this day.

### Not the beginning, but long, long ago

A lot of times, you spend more time working on other peoples' work, and neglect your own.

### In-class fun

This website was for fun, but a lot of the traditional web design

### Resume one-file to share

I wanted to create a single-file html page with embedded images in scalable format, so my resume looks good on any device. I still like it, but it isn't my pastel colours style.

### Gordon's full-circle website

This website design I came up with was hard-coded in HTML and CSS, but is inherently inflexible, because I could have used WordPress, I just wanted to make sure I still have the skills.

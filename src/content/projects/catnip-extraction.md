## About Catnip Plant to Essential Oil Extraction

> At Loyalist College my team, including Jennifer Hynes, performed independent research to extract the active ingredients from the catnip plant and put them into liquid form.

The project was entitled "Supercritical CO2 extraction of nepetalactones from Madjack brand catnip"

Using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (CO2) to extract the active ingredients (nepetalactones) that cats love, the process leaves no bi-products and the carbon dioxide evaporates from the final liquid product.

Liquid catnip extract can be safely sprayed onto cat toys, cat trees, and anything else you want your cat to enjoy.

To verify the final product contained nepetalactones and no harmful contaminants, we compared our compound to industry-standard compounds ordered from a chemical compound supplier.

### Oil of catnip

Presentation slide text:

The purpose of this project was to extract a class of compounds called “nepetalactones”, which are the active components in catnip.

This extract contains nepetalactones, and various other components within the matrix, and the extract is collectively called “Oil of Catnip”.

The extraction method chosen to extract the nepetalactones was supercritical carbon dioxide (Super CO2). The analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph.

Catnip products have a variety of uses, for both cats and humans alike.

### Gas Chromatography (GC) Chromatograms

Presentation slide text:

The reference standard, purified catnip analysed at a different laboratory, compared to our GC chromatograph shows that the catnip nepetalactones where extracted successfully!

### Solvent and analyte peaks on the overall GC chromatograph

Here we can see the solvent and analyte peaks on the full GC chromatograph.

### Other skills learned: 500+ Hours of Laboratory Time using Specialized Equipment

- Spectroscopy (UV, IR, Vis, NMR, MS, AA)
- Chromatography (paper, column, thin layer, GC, GC-MS, LC)
- Extraction (liquid, solid, Soxhlet, ultrasonic, microwave, supercritical)
- Evaporation, drying, titrations, humidity and distillation, refractometry, polarimetry, Kjeldahl, sifting, chemical reactors, heat exchange, Petri dish plating
- Field Placement and Over 550 hours of laboratory curriculum

### Other skills learned: Presentation Skills

From concise notetaking in and outside of the lab, to convincing peers of how to approach a difficult problem and presenting the final project, I have enjoyed learning how to present to my peers, technical audiences, lay-people, professors, and all types of people with different backgrounds.

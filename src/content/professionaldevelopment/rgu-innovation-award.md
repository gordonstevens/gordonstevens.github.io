### RGU Innovation Award
The RGU Innovation Award is an extra-curricular micro-credential which helped me to develop my competencies in being able to respond to disruption, participate in the process of innovation and design solutions. The award is open to all students at any stage of your studies and you can start and stop at any time. The award consists of three levels:

ðŸ”¸ Level 1 - Exploring innovations of the future through subject-focused workshops

ðŸ”¸ Level 2 - Putting innovation into action through participating in an interdisciplinary challenge event

ðŸ”¸ Level 3 - Leading innovative ideas through completing individual tasks to plan and reflect on a concept

By completing the RGU Innovation Award, I have undertaken experiences which can be used as examples for future recruitment situations as evidence of skills as well as acquiring a unique award to stand out from other candidates. When I completed the three levels I gained a certificate of participation which was noted on my Higher Education Achievement Record (HEAR). I have also received the full award certificate.

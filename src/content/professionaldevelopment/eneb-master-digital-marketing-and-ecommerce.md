### Accreditation and Discussion
<a href="https://eneb.com/accreditations/" target="_blank">Accreditation and Certification</a> in the EU by:
- Universidad Isabel I
- Barcelona Centre Universitari
- CECAP: Spanish Confederation of Private Centres and Academies
- ANCED: Spanish National Association of e-Learning and Distance Learning Centres
- EFQM: Quality and excellence certification with the highest score issued by the European Foundation for Quality Management.

Note: This degree is not accredited in North America by World Education Services ("WES"), the gate-keepers of education equivalency ratings in Canada, as they do not accept private accreditations. However it is recognised throughtout Europe and beyond. To complicate matters, ENEB is recognised in the USA by other <a href="https://www.naces.org/members" target="_blank">NAECS member companies</a>, the organisation which gives WES and WES Canada authority, but ENEB is still not recognised in Canada, therefore I have put this learning in the professional development of my website.

I decided to take this program as I feel the information is good and compliments my other learning well, and I was able to take it through ENEB's online learning platform.

description: Assisting people writing exams with disability accommodations
headline: As a university exam proctor for people with disabilities, I had the opportunity to support students who required special accommodations during their exams. My responsibilities included setting up the exam room, ensuring that the students had access to the appropriate equipment and materials, and monitoring the exam to ensure that all the rules were followed. I also had to ensure that the students were comfortable and had everything they needed to complete their exams. From my perspective, the experience was both challenging and rewarding. It required me to be patient, empathetic, and attentive to detail. I had to be flexible in accommodating different types of disabilities and making sure that each student had the accommodations they needed to perform at their best. It was gratifying to see how much of a difference my support made in helping these students overcome their challenges and succeed in their academic pursuits. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I feel proud to have been able to contribute to the success of these students.

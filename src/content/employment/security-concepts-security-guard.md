headline: As a security guard, my work experience involved providing safety and security at various locations, such as events, foreclosure properties, and other sites. My primary responsibility was to ensure the safety of people and property by monitoring for potential risks, suspicious activities, or safety hazards. I also interacted with visitors, employees, and clients to ensure they follow safety protocols and guidelines. At events, I managed crowds, checked for identification, and ensured that only authorized individuals entered restricted areas. At foreclosure properties, I secured the perimeter and protected the property from potential damages or theft. I also prepared reports and documented incidents that occurred during my shift. My work experience as a security guard has taught me how to think on my feet, communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds, and handle high-pressure situations. It has also helped me to develop strong observation and decision-making skills.

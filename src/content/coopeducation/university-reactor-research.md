description: As a co-op education student at UWO chemical reactor lab, my work experience involved researching and quantifying a pilot-scale reactor. I was responsible for conducting experiments, analyzing data, and presenting my findings to my supervisor. My day-to-day activities included running tests on the reactor, analyzing samples using various analytical techniques, and recording data electronically. I also participated in meetings with the research team to discuss progress, challenges, and future plans. Overall, my work experience in the chemical reactor lab was very enriching, as I gained hands-on experience in conducting scientific research, learned new laboratory techniques, and developed my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I enjoyed being part of a team working towards a common goal and contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge.

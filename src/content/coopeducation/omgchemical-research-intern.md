description: As a co-op education student at OMG Chemical Limited, my work experience in the laboratory was both challenging and rewarding. I was responsible for conducting experiments, analyzing data, and communicating results to my team. I worked on various projects related to the development of new chemical products, including research on the effectiveness of different chemicals in specific applications. One of the most exciting aspects of my work was the opportunity to work with laboratory equipment, including chromatography systems. I was able to gain valuable experience in operating and maintaining these instruments, which will be beneficial to me in my future career. Working at OMG Chemical Limited also allowed me to develop my communication and teamwork skills. I learned alot about working with regulations, and I collaborated with other researchers on a daily basis and learned how to effectively communicate my ideas and findings to them. Overall, my experience at OMG Chemical Limited was a great learning opportunity and gave me valuable hands-on experience in the field of chemical research. Company is now Soltex, www.soltexinc.com.

description: As a co-op education student at the University of Western Ontario (UWO, now also called Western University) genetics lab, my work focused on researching ways to disrupt pathogens in rainwater. My experience was both challenging and rewarding as I learned how to apply theoretical knowledge into practical research and laboratory work. I was responsible for conducting experiments, analyzing data, and presenting my findings to my supervisor and team members.

ðŸ”¸ During my time at the genetics lab, I gained valuable skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and time management. I learned how to work independently and as part of a team to achieve our research objectives. My supervisor provided me with guidance and support, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in genetic engineering and molecular biology techniques.

ðŸ”¸ Overall, my experience as a co-op education student at the UWO genetics lab was incredibly fulfilling, and I feel proud of the contributions I made to the research team. It was an excellent opportunity to work in a professional laboratory setting and apply my knowledge to a real-world problem while gaining valuable skills and experience.

ðŸ”¸ Conducted research on the disruption of a pathogen in rainwater samples, using various techniques such as DNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, and sequencing.

ðŸ”¸ Collaborated with other researchers in planning and executing experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and interpreting results to draw meaningful conclusions.

ðŸ”¸ Maintained meticulous records of experimental data, ensuring accuracy and integrity of data for analysis and reporting.

ðŸ”¸ Assisted in the preparation of research protocols, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and laboratory reports.

ðŸ”¸ Demonstrated proficiency in using specialized software and tools for data analysis, such as bioinformatics software, statistical analysis software, and data visualization tools.

ðŸ”¸ Modified DNA in a virus to attempt to inhibit the growth of a water-borne pathogen.

description: As a co-op education student at Nedco, Inc., I worked in the warehouse where my primary responsibilities included receiving, stocking, fulfilling orders for electrical supplies, and talking with electricians. Throughout my time at Nedco, I gained valuable experience in supply chain management, inventory control, and order fulfillment processes. In addition to my daily tasks, I had the opportunity to work on several projects, including developing a more efficient process for managing inventory, improving the accuracy of order fulfillment, and cleaning up the retail space of the store. I was also given the chance to work closely with the sales team to better understand customer needs and ensure that orders were fulfilled accurately and on time. Overall, my time at Nedco was a great learning experience, and I gained valuable knowledge and skills in the field of supply chain management. I appreciated the opportunity to work with a team of dedicated professionals who were always willing to help and teach me new things.

### Program Information:

- Community Economic Development: Developing communities through economic means using sustainability and inclusion of the community to better address all aspects of development.
- Importantly, due to poor management of the MBA program, and unclear accreditation for government funding, the government funding agency stopped funding the MBA program, and I was left with half of an MBA degree. I decided to pivot to International Business at Seneca College, a fully accredited and recognised institution.
